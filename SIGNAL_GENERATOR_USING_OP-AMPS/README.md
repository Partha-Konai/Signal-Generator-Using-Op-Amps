<h1> Signal Generator Using Op-Amps</h1><br><br>
Signal generator is an essential electronic instrument used to produce different types of<br>
electrical waveforms over a wide range of frequencies. Such waveforms include square <br>
waves, triangular waves, and sine waves, which are widely used in testing, troubleshooting, <br>
and designing electronic circuits. This project focuses on designing a function generator using <br>
commonly available components such as UA741 op-amps, diodes, and passive components. <br>
The generator produces three distinct outputs: (1) Square Wave, (2) Triangular Wave & (3) <br>
Sine Wave. The design is intended for students, hobbyists, and laboratory applications where <br>
low-cost waveform generation is required.
